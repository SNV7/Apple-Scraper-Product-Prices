# Apple-Scraper-Product-Prices
This script was written to automate data extraction for the Apple Price Arbitrage project.
When UpdateData.js is run, will extract products prices for various iPad and MacBook products, from all of Apple's online stores. Converts all prices to USD and stores results in a MongoDB database.
